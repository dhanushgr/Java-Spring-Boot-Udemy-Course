Notes of Spring, SpringBoot and its related concepts.

Tightly coupled:
        I had to create a new variable
        I had to create a constructor for the game
        cannot have both the games with the same variable, if I had to run
        superContraGame then I have to comment out the MarioGame otherwise
        there will be an error in variables.
        If you give diff variable names for each game, then run() method has
        to change, according to the game, every time.

Loosely Coupled:
        we can make it loosely coupled by making iit connect to a interface and
        using it by implementing that interface to the class which are connected


Spring Container/Spring Context/IOC[Inversion Of Container] Container:
    - which manages the Spring Beans and their lifecycle.
    - has 2 types of spring containers
        1. Bean Factory:
            most basic container
        2. Application Context:
            Advance Spring Container with enterprise specific features
